========================================
Keystone, the OpenStack Identity Service
========================================

Keystone is an OpenStack service that provides API client authentication,
service discovery, and distributed multi-tenant authorization by implementing
`OpenStack's Identity API`_.

This documentation is useful for contributors looking to get involved in our
community, developers writing applications on top of OpenStack, and operators
administering their own OpenStack deployments.

This documentation is generated by the Sphinx toolkit and lives in the `source
tree`_. Also see the :doc:`getting-started/community` page for other ways to interact with the
community.
