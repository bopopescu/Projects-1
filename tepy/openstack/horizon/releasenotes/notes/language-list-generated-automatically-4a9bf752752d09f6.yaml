    The available language list is now automatically generated based on
    the availability of translation message catalogs of languages
    instead of maintaining the language list manually.
    If message catalogs (PO files) of some language exist for both
    django and djangojs domains of horizon and openstack_dashboard,
    the language will appear in the language list.
    If you need to change the initial set of languages,
    set ``LANGUAGES`` in ``local_settings.py``.
